	Load propagation manifests from meta/propagation/manifests.yaml.

	Reads the YAML data file under template_root and converts each section to the

	routing_overrides exclude_repos value becomes a frozenset, conditional_overlays
	keeps its nested-dict structure, and meta_test_prefixes becomes a tuple.
